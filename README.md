Operating System Concepts – Examples & Exercises  
Repository by Atharva Kadam (ak26009)

Purpose  
This repo collects sample code and learning material tied to classic operating system topics (based on *Silberschatz et al., Operating System Concepts*). 
The aim is to provide working C-programs and slides for key OS mechanisms: process control, interprocess communication, synchronization, pipes, forks/exec, etc.

What’s inside  
- `pipe.c` — Example of using `pipe()`, reading/writing between processes.  
- `fork_exec_pipe.zip` — Exercise: combine `fork()`, `exec()` and pipes for simple producer/consumer.  
- `Process Sync/` — Folder with code covering process synchronization (mutexes, semaphores) via C.  
- `Threads/` — Example code using threads (creation, joining, data sharing).  
- `OS_PPT.zip` — Slide deck summarising OS concepts (processes, memory, I/O, IPC).  
- `Silberschatz-Operating System Concepts (9th,2012_12).pdf` — The text used for reference.
